# RUG (R User Group)

R User's Group (i.e., RUG) is a place for newbies and experts alike to learn and work together on projects using the statistical programming language, R. Do you want to learn the best practices for creating a reproducible workflow but don't know where to begin? Struggling to figure out the best methods for wrangling a messy data set? Want to build a clean and professional website using free and open-source tools? We can do all this and more using R! Join us as we learn how to unlock the full potential of the R ecosystem.
